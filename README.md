# Web Components 2.0

Storing web components in HTML rather than JavaScript

Borrowed heavily from:
  - Florian Shulz's article: ["Why donâ€™t we use HTML to author web components?"](https://medium.com/@getflourish/why-dont-we-use-html-to-author-web-components-10440432390e)
  - Florian Shulz's [demo of that article](https://gist.github.com/getflourish/a87b990265db8fc243c897f34d32f860)

Also inspired from:
  - Joe Honton's article ["Solving the Trilingual Challenge"](https://codeburst.io/2020-029-solving-the-trilingual-challenge-980faf1218d2)

My Additions:
  - Storing the information previously stored in attributes on the body element as meta elements in the head
